  "Text": "(The ink on this letter is still wet.)\n(It looks as if you are the only person to have read it.)\n\nHey! I'm so sorry about what I said about your brother yesterday. I can understand why you got upset, and I don't blame you for anything you said to me. I deserved it.\n\nDo you believe that everyone is a good person if you get to know them well enough? I hope that's true. Even if it isn't, I think the world would be a better place if we all behaved like it was. I don't know your brother, and I can't explain why he did what he did. But I believe that as far as he was concerned, he was doing what was best for the people he loved.\n\nThat's what everyone's doing at the end of the day. Look at us. It's not as if we want to work here. We're doing it to feed our children, make sure they get a good education and end up better off than we did. What could be more good than that?\n\nAnyway, would you mind feeding my cat every day next week? I'm going away with some friends in a couple of days, and there wouldn't be anyone to take care of her when I'm gone otherwise. You still have the spare key, right?\n\nSorry again for what I said. I hope you can forgive me! :-)\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe gremlin who sits across the table from you."
