  "Text": "Dear Mr Mentoe,\n\nI regret to inform you that we can no longer allow your children to be enrolled at our school. There have been too many instances where the staff and I have come to worry about the safety of your children and the other students.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have the staff or the facilities available to maintain order amongst the other children and yours. As you already know, there have been many instances of prejudice-related conflicts arising amongst the children.\n\nWe have tried many approaches towards resolving the problem by educating the children about the importance of equality and acceptance to enforcing sanctions and detentions upon discriminatory action taking place on and off school grounds, however it has come to my attention that the prejudices have been evoked by word of mouth of the parents amongst each other and the students.\n\nIt has even come to my knowledge that other members of staff are also “picking favourites” among the children: Some members of staff are ignoring your children's merits, gossiping with other students during detention, avoiding protocol when issuing punishments in favour of other students, and there have even been a few instances physical bullying.\n\nI fully understand if you would like to press charges against the school under misconduct—I for one will back you the whole way—however, certain diplomatic rules may rule against your favour.\n\nI do however have the contact information of many commendable private tutors, whose services might suit your needs better.\n\nI wish it didn’t have to come to this but under much deliberation and fruitless trials, this was the last course of action I had to take.\n\nYour's sincerely,\n\n(It is signed by the headmaster of a nearby school.)"
