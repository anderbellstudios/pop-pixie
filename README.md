# Pop Pixie

ðŸ•¹ We're making a video game!

## What's Pop Pixie?

Pop Pixie is an indie video game currently being developed by a small team of volunteers.

We built the demo of Pop Pixie for the 2019 BAFTA Young Game Designers competition. It was nominated as one of the ten finalists in its category, and we attended the YGD award ceremony in London. (The winner was the excellent [Wip](http://ygd.bafta.org/competition/competition-news/2019/wip) by Adam Pace.)

Since then, we've been working on making Pop Pixie into a full game. We've had a few setbacks, including having to redo almost all of our artwork, but we're making progress.

We're hoping to release *Pop Pixie: Mission Training*, a short supplementary prequel game, in spring 2022. After that, we'll resume work on the main game, releasing new levels and updates as often as we can.

## Can I play it?

The only versions of Pop Pixie currently released online are the early demos, which include artwork that was unintentionally plagiarised from other artists. (The person responsible for this has since left the team, and we've apologised to the affected artists.)

All active development is currently taking place on the [training-game](https://github.com/anderbellstudios/pop-pixie/tree/training-game) branch. You're free to explore the source code and run the dev version of the game in Unity, but be warned that Pop Pixie depends on the proprietary [Rewired](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/rewired-21676) input system, which you will need to purchase and manually include.
